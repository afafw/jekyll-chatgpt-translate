[![rake](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-chatgpt-translate/actions/workflows/rake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-chatgpt-translate/actions/workflows/rake.yml)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-chatgpt-translate.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-chatgpt-translate)

If you have a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site, this plugin may help you automatically
translate its pages to another language, through [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). See how it 
works for [my blog](https://github.com/yegor256/ru.yegor256.com), 
for example [this page](https://ru.yegor256.com/2023-08-13-dictators.html) is translated to 
[English]().

Install it first:

```
gem install jekyll-chatgpt-translate
```

Then, add this to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
chatgpt-translate:
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
  source: en
  layout: translated
  targets: 
    - 
      language: cn
      permalink: :year-:month-:day-:slug-chinese.html
      layout: chinese-translated
    - 
      language: fr
      permalink: :year-:month-:day-:title-french.html
```

Here, the source language is English (`en`), the target one is Chinese (`cn`),
the layout is `_layout/translated.html` (you must have this file).

OpenAI API KEY must be set in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, otherwise
the plugin will not do any translation and won't generate translated pages. 
You can get your key [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

Inside the original page you can use `{{ page.translated-XX-url }}` in order to render the URL
of the translated page, where `XX` is the ISO-839-1 code of the target language..
Inside the translated page you can use `{{ page.translated-original-url }}` in order
to get the URL of the page that was translated. You can also use `{{ page.chatgpt-model }}`
inside both the original page and the translated one, to refer to the model of ChatGPT.
